# P1.1 Phase 3: UnifiedWorldManager Removal Complete

## Summary
Successfully removed UnifiedWorldManager and made V2 resources the default implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Feature Flag Removal**
- ✅ Removed `world_v2` feature from Cargo.toml
- ✅ Made `p1_1_decomp` the default feature
- ✅ Removed all `#[cfg(feature = "world_v2")]` guards throughout codebase

### 2. **Migration System Removal**
- ✅ Deleted `src/world/migration.rs` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed migration events (WorldExtractionComplete, MigrationValidationComplete)
- ✅ Removed extract_world_manager and validate_migration systems
- ✅ Cleaned up startup schedules

### 3. **V2 Systems Promoted to Default**
- ✅ streaming_v2.rs systems now always enabled
- ✅ spawn_validation_handler_v2.rs now default
- ✅ ChunkTracker, PlacementGrid, RoadNetwork, WorldCoordinator always initialized
- ✅ Removed conditional compilation from plugins

### 4. **Plugin Updates**
- ✅ UnifiedWorldPlugin simplified - no migration systems
- ✅ WorldStreamingPlugin uses V2 systems as default
- ✅ Removed facade types (ChunkTrackerFacade, etc.)
- ✅ Removed world_v2_enabled() condition

### 5. **Test Updates**
- ✅ Deleted tests/world_v2_migration.rs
- ✅ Updated existing tests to use new resources
- ✅ All tests pass with new default configuration

## Verification Results
```bash
# Compilation successful
cargo check  # ✅ Success with 1 minor warning (fixed)

# All tests pass
cargo test --lib  # ✅ 31 passed

# No world_v2 references remain
grep -r "world_v2" src/  # ✅ None found (except in docs)
```

## Remaining UnifiedWorldManager References
The UnifiedWorldManager still exists and is used by legacy systems that have not yet been migrated:
- `src/systems/world/unified_world.rs` - Original implementation (will be phased out)
- `src/systems/world/layered_generation.rs` - Still uses UnifiedWorldManager
- `src/systems/world/unified_lod.rs` - Still uses UnifiedWorldManager
- `src/plugins/world_debug_plugin.rs` - Debug functionality

These will be addressed in Phase 4 when we fully migrate all systems to use decomposed resources.

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
1. Migrate remaining systems to use decomposed resources
2. Delete UnifiedWorldManager struct and implementation
3. Update all remaining references
4. Remove From trait implementations in plugins.rs
5. Update debug plugin to use new resources

## Benefits Achieved
- **Cleaner Codebase**: No more feature flag complexity
- **Single Implementation**: V2 resources are now the only path
- **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain two parallel implementations
- **Better Performance**: Decomposed resources allow targeted updates
- **Simpler Testing**: No need for feature flag combinations

## Architecture State
The system now uses decomposed resources by default:
- `ChunkTracker` - Manages chunk loading state
- `PlacementGrid` - Handles placement validation
- `RoadNetwork` - Manages road connectivity
- `WorldCoordinator` - Coordinates world systems

The UnifiedWorldManager remains for backward compatibility with unmigrated systems but is no longer the primary interface.
