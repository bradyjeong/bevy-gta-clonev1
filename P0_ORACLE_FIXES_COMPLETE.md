# P0 Oracle Fixes Complete

## Summary
Fixed two critical P0 violations identified by oracle review to ensure proper event-driven architecture compliance.

## Issue 1: PlacementGrid Resource Violation ✅
**Problem**: PlacementGrid was embedded in unified_world.rs without #[derive(Resource)], violating ECS resource requirements.

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate PlacementGrid definition from unified_world.rs (lines 93-184)
- PlacementGrid properly exists in src/world/placement_grid.rs with #[derive(Resource)]
- Systems already use ResMut<PlacementGrid> correctly

## Issue 2: Chunk Loading State Machine Bug ✅
**Problem**: Chunk state was transitioning to Loaded immediately before generation finished, breaking event-driven contract.

**Solution**:
1. Added `ChunkFinishedLoading` event in chunk_events.rs
2. Modified `request_chunk_loading_new` to keep state as Loading
3. Added `handle_chunk_finished_loading` system to handle state transition
4. Updated `layered_generation_coordinator` to emit ChunkFinishedLoading when all layers complete
5. Registered handler in WorldStreamingPlugin

### Event Flow After Fix:
1. Streaming system sets chunk.state = Loading
2. Streaming system emits RequestChunkLoad
3. Generation systems process layers (roads → buildings → vehicles → vegetation)
4. When all layers complete, generation emits ChunkFinishedLoading
5. Handler transitions chunk.state = Loaded { lod_level }

## Files Modified:
- src/systems/world/unified_world.rs - Removed duplicate PlacementGrid, fixed state machine
- src/events/world/chunk_events.rs - Added ChunkFinishedLoading event
- src/systems/world/layered_generation.rs - Emit event when generation completes
- src/plugins/world_streaming_plugin.rs - Register event handler

## Verification:
- ✅ cargo check passes
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Event-driven architecture maintained
- ✅ Single source of truth for PlacementGrid resource
- ✅ Proper state machine transitions via events
