## 🔴 NEW ISSUES FOUND

### Issue 6: Vegetation Chunk Size Mismatch
**Discovered**: Oracle diff audit  
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Misalignment risk  
**Status**: NEEDS FIX

**Problem**:
- World manager uses `chunk_size: 128.0` (from config)
- Vegetation generator uses `UNIFIED_CHUNK_SIZE: 200.0` (hardcoded constant)
- Mismatch causes vegetation to be placed on wrong grid

**Evidence**:
```rust
// src/config.rs - line 274
chunk_size: 128.0

// src/systems/world/generators/vegetation_generator.rs - line ~25
const UNIFIED_CHUNK_SIZE: f32 = 200.0; // WRONG!
let half_size = UNIFIED_CHUNK_SIZE * 0.5; // Using 200m instead of 128m
```

**Impact**:
- Trees may spawn misaligned with chunk boundaries
- Chunk-based cleanup could miss entities
- Distance calculations incorrect

**Fix Required**: Use `world.chunk_size` instead of hardcoded constant

### Issue 7: NPC Cap Hardcoded at 20
**Discovered**: Oracle diff audit  
**Severity**: 🟢 LOW - Behavioral change  
**Status**: MINOR IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDED

**Problem**:
- NPC spawn has hardcoded limit: `if npc_query.iter().count() >= 20`
- Not configurable
- Much lower than EntityLimits.max_npcs (150)

**Evidence**:
```rust
// src/systems/world/npc_spawn.rs - line 31
if npc_query.iter().count() >= 20 {
    // REDUCED: From 100 to 20 NPCs max
    return;
}
```

**Impact**:
- NPCs capped at 20 even though limits allow 150
- Hard to adjust without code changes
- Comment says "REDUCED from 100"

**Fix Recommended**: Use EntityLimits.max_npcs or config value

---

## ✅ INTENTIONAL CHANGES (Confirmed Safe)

### 1. Palm Trees Now Procedural ✅
**Status**: Working as designed  
**Evidence**:
- `setup_palm_trees()` still exists in environment.rs
- Just not called at startup
- VegetationGenerator spawns palms procedurally per chunk
- Logs show vegetation generation happening

**Verdict**: Intentional - procedural is better than fixed positions

---

### 2. World Size Reduced 12km → 4km ✅
**Status**: Intentional breaking change  
**Evidence**:
- Config explicitly changed: 12000.0 → 4000.0
- Comments updated: "4km world", "31x31 chunks"
- Docs mention "BREAKING CHANGE"
- Chunks reduced from 8,836 → 961 (10x faster loading)

**Verdict**: Intentional - faster testing/iteration

---

### 3. Ground Detection Simplified ✅
**Status**: Safe for current flat terrain  
**Risk**: Would break if terrain becomes hilly

**Before**: Physics raycast from 100m height to find ground
**After**: Returns constant 0.05 (terrain collider top)

**Evidence**:
- Terrain IS flat (setup/world.rs creates plane at y=0)
- All spawns work correctly in logs
- Simplified service removes physics dependency

**Verdict**: Intentional - works for flat terrain, document assumption

---

### 4. ActiveEntityTransferred Event Removed ✅
**Status**: Replaced with better pattern  
**Evidence**:
- Event was fired but had NO LISTENERS (Oracle verified)
- Replaced with component-based ActiveTransferRequest
- Transfer still works (logs show vehicle enter/exit)

**Verdict**: Good deletion - unused event removed

---

### 5. Spawn Validation "CRITICAL FIX" Comments ✅
**Status**: Correctness improvements  
**Changes**:
- Road spacing logic fixed (allows vehicles on roads)
- Neighbor cell search fixed (was missing edge cases)
- Search radius increased to 64m (safer collision detection)
- Cleanup cursor prevents missed entities

**Verdict**: Good fixes - not regressions

---

### 6. Building Physics Deferred ✅
**Status**: Working as designed  
**Evidence**:
- Buildings spawn WITHOUT RigidBody/Collider
- Physics added later by PhysicsActivationPlugin (GTA-style)
- Comments added: "NO PHYSICS AT SPAWN - added dynamically"

**Verdict**: Intentional - GTA-style dynamic physics activation

## Palm Trees - Deep Dive

**Are palm trees spawning?** Let me check the logs...

From runtime output:
```
(no "palm" mentions in logs - need to verify vegetation generator runs)
```

**Vegetation generator check needed**:
- Is VegetationGenerator actually called during world gen?
- Are trees spawning procedurally?
- Or did we break procedural generation too?

**Action**: Check if trees are actually spawning in-game

---

## Ground Detection - Risk Analysis

**Current**: Returns constant 0.05
**Terrain**: Flat plane at y=0

**Safe scenarios**:
- ✅ Flat terrain (current)
- ✅ Minimal height variation

**Breaks if**:
- ❌ Terrain becomes hilly
- ❌ Buildings at different elevations
- ❌ Heightmap terrain
- ❌ Multi-level structures

**Recommendation**: Add assertion
```rust
// In ground_detection.rs
pub fn get_ground_height_simple(&self, _position: Vec2) -> f32 {
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    {
        // ASSERTION: This assumes flat terrain at y=0.05
        // If terrain becomes non-flat, re-enable raycast-based detection
    }
    0.05
}
```
