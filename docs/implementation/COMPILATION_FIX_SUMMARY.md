# Compilation Issues Fixed

## 🐛 **Issue 1: Duplicate Function Names**
**Problem**: Two functions named `setup_unified_entity_factory` in different files
- `src/factories/entity_factory_unified.rs` 
- `src/systems/world/unified_factory_setup.rs`

**Solution**: ✅ Renamed the factory version to `setup_unified_entity_factory_basic`

## 🐛 **Issue 2: Component Type Mismatch**
**Problem**: Bundles were using old `Cullable` component instead of new `UnifiedCullable`
- All bundles in `src/bundles.rs` had `pub cullable: Cullable`
- But the new unified system uses `UnifiedCullable`

**Solution**: ✅ Updated all 8 bundle definitions to use `UnifiedCullable`
- Added import: `use crate::systems::world::unified_distance_culling::UnifiedCullable;`
- Replaced all `pub cullable: Cullable,` with `pub cullable: UnifiedCullable,`

## 🔧 **Files Modified**
1. `src/factories/entity_factory_unified.rs` - Renamed function to avoid collision
2. `src/bundles.rs` - Updated component types and added import

## 🎯 **Expected Result** 
These fixes should resolve the main compilation issues preventing `cargo run`. The terminal spawning issue (`posix_spawnp failed`) appears to be a system-level problem unrelated to code compilation.

## 🧪 **Next Steps**
When terminal access is restored, test with:
```bash
cargo check  # Verify compilation
cargo build  # Full build
cargo run    # Run the game
```

The Phase 1 & 2 systems should now compile successfully and be ready for integration.
