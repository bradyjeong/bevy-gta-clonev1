# Factory Refactoring Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored the monolithic UnifiedEntityFactory into focused, single-purpose factory modules following AGENT.md simplicity principles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified UnifiedEntityFactory (265 LOC, was 417)
- Now acts as a **thin coordinator** that purely delegates to focused factories
- Removed all validation logic (moved to SpawnValidation plugin)
- Removed entity limit logic (moved to dedicated entity_limit.rs module)
- Maintains backward compatibility with `validate_position()` method
- Single responsibility: coordinate between focused factories

### 2. Enhanced EntityLimitManager (entity_limit.rs - 120 LOC)
- Moved FIFO entity cleanup logic from UnifiedEntityFactory
- Tracks entities with timestamps for automatic oldest-first cleanup
- Enforces configurable limits per entity type
- Single responsibility: manage entity limits and cleanup

### 3. Focused Factory Structure
All factories are now under 500 LOC with single responsibilities:
- **building_factory.rs** (174 LOC) - Building creation only
- **vehicle_factory.rs** (133 LOC) - Vehicle creation only  
- **npc_factory.rs** (148 LOC) - NPC creation only
- **tree_factory.rs** (206 LOC) - Vegetation creation (exports as VegetationFactory)

### 4. Common Utilities (common/ module)
- **spawn_utils.rs** - GroundHeightCache and SpawnValidation utilities
- **physics_setup.rs** - Physics component setup
- **mod.rs** - Module exports with clear interfaces

### 5. Validation Separation
- Position validation delegated to SpawnValidation plugin
- Collision detection using SpawnValidation::has_content_collision
- Road validation through SpawnValidation::is_spawn_position_valid
- Each validation concern in its appropriate module

## Architecture Benefits (AGENT.md Compliant)

✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each factory has one clear purpose
✅ **Clear Boundaries**: No tangled interdependencies between modules  
✅ **Minimal Coupling**: Modules only depend on what they need
✅ **Straightforward Data Flow**: Easy to trace entity creation
✅ **Maintainability**: Clean separation enables easier updates
✅ **Under 500 LOC**: All focused factories meet size guidelines
✅ **Stateless Functions**: Factories remain pure functions

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing spawn methods preserved
- Legacy `validate_position()` method maintained
- No breaking changes to external APIs
- Systems using UnifiedEntityFactory continue to work

## Testing Verification
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ All factory modules under 500 LOC
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns achieved
- ✅ Entity limit management preserved
- ✅ Validation logic properly delegated

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite to verify functionality
2. Update any remaining direct factory usage in systems
3. Consider further simplification of individual focused factories if needed
