# Commit Ready ✅

## Summary
Performance optimizations and critical bug fix - ready to commit to main.

## Changes Overview

### Performance Optimizations (5 improvements)
1. ✅ Fixed 60Hz physics timestep
2. ✅ Reduced visibility distance (1500m → 1000m)
3. ✅ Enabled CCD for F16 only
4. ✅ Throttled non-critical systems (10Hz/2Hz)
5. ✅ Centralized visibility ranges to config

### Critical Bug Fix
✅ Player physics corruption in vehicles (was flying to 131km+)

### Code Quality Fixes (from Oracle review)
✅ Fixed chunk count regression (removed incorrect min=50 clamp)  
✅ Removed no-op vehicle physics disable  
✅ Cleaned up VehicleControlType on player when entering vehicles

## Files Modified

### Core Systems
- `src/plugins/game_core.rs` - Physics timestep, throttling
- `src/systems/interaction.rs` - Player physics, vehicle entry cleanup
- `src/config.rs` - Visibility distance, chunk count fix

### Factories
- `src/factories/vehicle_factory.rs` - Config-driven visibility
- `src/factories/building_factory.rs` - Config-driven visibility

## Validation Complete ✅

### Pre-commit Checks
- ✅ `cargo check` - PASSED
- ✅ `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` - PASSED
- ✅ `cargo test` - PASSED (11/11 tests)

## Suggested Commit Message

```
feat: performance optimizations and player physics bugfix

Performance Improvements:
- Lock physics to 60Hz fixed timestep for consistency
- Reduce max_visible_distance from 1500m to 1000m
- Enable CCD for F16 to prevent high-speed tunneling
- Throttle physics safeguards to 10Hz (from 60Hz)
- Throttle entity limits to 2Hz (from 60Hz)
- Centralize visibility ranges to config for easy tuning

Critical Bug Fix:
- Fix player physics corruption in vehicles
  * Player RigidBody stayed active while parented to moving vehicles
  * Caused position corruption to extreme distances (131km+)
  * Solution: Add RigidBodyDisabled to player when entering vehicles

Code Quality:
- Fix chunk count validation (removed incorrect min=50 clamp)
- Remove no-op vehicle physics disable on entry
- Clean up VehicleControlType from player in vehicles

Expected: 15-30% FPS improvement, no physics corruption
