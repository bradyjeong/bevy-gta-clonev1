# P1.1 FINAL COMPLETE: Resource Guidelines Applied

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Applied Resource Size Guidelines
Successfully implemented the nuanced resource size guidelines from updated AGENT.md:

#### Hot-Path Resources (≤64 bytes)
1. **ChunkTracker**: 64 bytes exactly
   - Reduced from 4 to 3 loaded chunks array  
   - Accessed every frame by streaming systems
   - Static assertion enforced

2. **WorldCoordinator**: ≤32 bytes
   - Lightweight coordinator for world resources
   - Accessed frequently for focus position updates
   - Static assertion enforced

3. **PlacementGrid**: ≤24 bytes  
   - Spatial grid for collision detection
   - Accessed per-frame for placement validation
   - Static assertion enforced

#### Cache Resources (Larger OK)
1. **ChunkTables**: Unbounded size
   - HashMap-based storage for chunk data
   - Accessed <100 times/frame for lookups
   - No size restriction needed

2. **RoadNetwork**: 32 bytes (optimized but cache)
   - Used for pathfinding queries
   - Accessed infrequently (<100 times/frame)
   - Size optimized for efficiency but not critical

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. ChunkTracker Split
- **Before**: Single resource with HashMaps (too large)
- **After**: 
  - ChunkTracker: Hot-path data (64 bytes)
  - ChunkTables: Dynamic data with HashMaps

#### 2. Updated Systems
- `streaming_v2.rs`: Now uses both ChunkTracker and ChunkTables
- `world_streaming_plugin.rs`: Properly initializes both resources
- All systems updated to use appropriate resource for access pattern

#### 3. Removed Migration Artifacts
- Deleted V2 compatibility methods from ChunkTracker
- Removed migration methods from WorldCoordinator
- Cleaned up PlacementGrid compatibility methods
- Removed RoadNetwork reset method

### Verification
- ✅ `cargo check` passes
- ✅ `cargo build --release` succeeds
- ✅ Hot-path resources have static assertions
- ✅ Cache resources properly classified
- ✅ All migration artifacts removed

### Performance Benefits
- **Cache Efficiency**: Hot-path resources fit in CPU cache lines
- **Memory Access**: Predictable access patterns for per-frame data
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dynamic data isolated from hot-path
- **Maintainability**: Clear distinction between access patterns

## Oracle's Requirements Met
1. ✅ ChunkTracker classified as hot-path (≤64 bytes)
2. ✅ Split into ChunkTracker + ChunkTables
3. ✅ Static assertions for hot-path resources only
4. ✅ Migration artifacts removed
5. ✅ Systems updated to use split resources
6. ✅ All tests passing

## Next Steps
P1.1 is now complete with proper resource size management following the updated AGENT.md guidelines.
