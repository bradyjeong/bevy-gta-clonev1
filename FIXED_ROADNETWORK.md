# RoadNetwork Fix Summary

## The Problem
We had **TWO conflicting RoadNetwork implementations**:
1. `src/systems/world/road_network.rs` - Full implementation with HashMap, splines, pathfinding
2. `src/world/road_network.rs` - Broken 4-node demo with u16 coordinates

All systems were using the broken demo version, which:
- Only stored 4 nodes max
- Used u16 coordinates that broke with negative positions
- Always returned `false` for `is_near_road()`

## The Fix
1. ✅ Replaced demo with real implementation
2. ✅ Added missing compatibility methods (`is_near_road`, `get_nearest_road_point`, `add_node`, `connect_nodes`)
3. ✅ Fixed coordinate storage (u16 → f32)
4. ✅ Fixed node spacing (100.0 → 50.0 for proper grid)
5. ✅ Added Road to ContentType enum
6. ✅ Fixed PlacementGrid to use ContentType::Road

## Current Status
- **720 roads are now being generated!** 
- Event pipeline is working correctly
- Validation is still failing because roads aren't registered in RoadNetwork when created

## Remaining Issues
1. Roads created by `layered_generation` aren't being added to the RoadNetwork resource
2. The `add_node()` compatibility method needs to actually register roads properly
3. Validation happens before roads are fully registered

## Next Steps
1. Fix `add_node()` to properly register roads in the network
2. Ensure road layer completes before building/vehicle validation
3. Test that entities become visible
