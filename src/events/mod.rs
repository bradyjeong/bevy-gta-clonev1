//! Event-driven communication system for cross-plugin coordination
//! 
//! This module provides lightweight events (â‰¤128 bytes, Copy/Clone) that enable
//! decoupled communication between plugins while maintaining explicit data flow.
//! 
//! Each event group is organized in its own module with clear purpose documentation.
